# Data Science and Machine Learning

Welcome to the "Data Science and Machine Learning" category, where you'll embark on an exciting journey into the world of data science and machine learning using Python. In this category, you'll dive deep into the field of data science and explore techniques to extract insights from data, make predictions, and build intelligent systems.

We will undertake an exciting project in this category which is building a movie recommendation system. By applying various data science and machine learning techniques, you'll develop a system that suggests personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences.
